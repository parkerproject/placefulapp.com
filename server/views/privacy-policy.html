  <h1>Placeful Privacy Policy </h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Placeful collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the Placeful website(www.Placeful.co) (“App” and/or “Site.") By viewing, accessing, using or browsing
    the App and/or Website, or by registering as a member of the Service (as defined herein), you agree to this privacy policy and the Terms of Use of said web property as a binding legal agreement between you and Placeful, without limitation or qualification.
    </p>

  <h2>Personal identification information</h2>
  <p>Placeful keeps track of the user's activities within the app in order to gather usage statistics for its mobile app. UDID are not associated with other information about a user, but only indicate general visitor navigation patterns. Placeful App has
    embedded tags that allow some third party entities such as Google Analytics, and/or similar services to collect non-personally identifiable usage statistics.</p>

  <h2>Submission and Processing of Information</h2>
  <p>When you subscribe or sign up to the App, Placeful may ask you for certain personally identifiable information. This personally identifiable information may include information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name and email
    address. You must agree to the Terms of Use of this App before making any comments or leaving any reviews on any posting.</p>

  <h2>User Postings</h2>
  <p>Except as otherwise expressly described in this Privacy Policy, this policy only addresses the use and disclosure of Personal Information and other information we collect from you. In the course of your use of the App, including when you create a profile
    on the App, you may elect to post or otherwise disclose information about yourself and others, which may include Personal Information or other personally identifiable information. You may also elect to communicate with others or upload content such
    as photographs.</p>

  <h2>Third Party Apps</h2>
  <p>The App may contain links to other Apps. Placeful is not responsible for the privacy practices of such Apps. It is the User's responsibility to review the privacy policies at those Apps to confirm that they are acceptable prior to use. A link does not
    constitute an endorsement of the content, viewpoint or accuracy of such Apps.</p>

  <h2>Marketing Communications</h2>
  <p>If you have used the App before, it is possible that Placeful has data about you already and it is being used to contact you about offers, events, items or related activities. If you are an existing customer, Placeful will continue to keep you informed
    unless you revoke your consent via the procedures set forth below.</p>
  <p>If you are a new user, Placeful will give you the choice (for example, once you have subscribed or signed up) whether or not you want to receive emails regarding future offers, events and new services or related activities. Placeful will not bombard
    you with emails, but Placeful, with your consent, would like to keep you informed of any developments on the App.</p>

  <p>If you have consented to receive such information, you may always revoke that consent at any time by informing the Placeful team.</p>

  <h2>Confidentiality and Security of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Transmission of data and information via the App is not a secure or encrypted transmission method for sending your Personal Information, unless otherwise indicated on the App. Accordingly, your attention is drawn to the fact that any information and
    personal data carried over the Internet is not secure. Personal Information may be intercepted, lost, redirected, corrupted, changed and accessed by other people. </p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Placeful is committed to using all reasonable efforts to protect Personal Information collected through the App against unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Consequently, we limit employees' access to Personal Information collected
    through the App to only those employees who need access to the information in the performance of their official duties. </p>
  <p>In addition, we set strict security standards to prevent any unauthorized access to your Personal Information once we have received it and wherever possible we will use adequate security software and working procedures to ensure the security of your
    personal data. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and ensure proper use of Personal Information, we have employed physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we collect online. These
    measures include limiting the number of people who have physical access to Placeful database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections which guard against unauthorized access.</p>

  <p>Data in our Logs. When you use Placeful or go to a webpage or use an app that has Placeful features (like our “Share It” button), our system automatically records that information (“data in our logs”) including information that your internet browser
    sends whenever you search a App or your mobile application sends when you’re using it going to and from different applications. The data in our logs may also include your IP address, the address of the most recent web pages you’ve visited that had
    Placeful features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Placeful, and cookie data.</p>

  <h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries and our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties if you have consented to such disclosure.
    In addition, we may disclose or provide access to your Personal Information to third parties without your consent: if we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your Personal Information to the prospective seller or buyer
    of such business or assets;</p>

  <p>if Placeful or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personal Information held by it about its customers will, in most instances, be one of the transferred assets;</p>

  <p>if we ask a third party to carry out data analysis, cleansing and/or market research on our behalf; for the purpose of validating the identity of the user and/or conducting background checks; or if we have a good faith belief that we are under a duty
    to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation (such as in connection with a law enforcement request, judicial proceeding, court order or legal process), or in order to enforce or apply our policy or to protect
    the rights, property, or safety of Placeful, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

  <h2>Children's Online Privacy</h2>
  <p>It is important to Placeful that parents and guardians have control over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is or may be used. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") imposes restrictions
    on commercial Apps, including ours. It is our policy to be compliant with the requirements of COPPA and not to solicit or collect information about or from children age 13 and under.</p>

  <p>Beyond the requirements of COPPA, we require that individuals be age 18 or over to register as a member of the Service and thus it is our policy not to solicit or collect information about or from anyone under the age of 18. Users are cautioned, however,
    that absent a clear indication an online communication has been submitted by a person under age 18, the collection of Personal Information submitted to the App will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access
    by federal or state law, be subject to public access.</p>

  <p>In the event that Placeful receives an online communication clearly indicating that it has been submitted by a person under the age of 18, under no circumstances will any Personal Information be published on the App, be used for a purpose not intended
    by its sender or shared with third parties.</p>

    notify you by e-mail. All changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective upon posting to the App. Please be sure to regularly check our Privacy Policy before using the App. Continued use of the App shall indicate your acceptance of any changes to
